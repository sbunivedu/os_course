# Semaphores

Please read the relevant chapters on semaphores and answer the questions:

1. Define a semaphore (including the semantics of `sem_wait()` and `sem_post()`) and distinguish between a binary semaphore and a counting semaphore.

2. Explain how semaphores can be used to implement both mutual exclusion (like locks) and waiting/signalling (like condition variables).
