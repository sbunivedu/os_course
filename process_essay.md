# What is a process?

The textbook introduces process as a core abstraction of the OS. Please read the relevant chapters
and answer the questions:

1. Define in your own words what a process is (and how it differs from a program).

2. Describe the major components of a process’s “machine state” (e.g., registers, address space, I/O state).

3. Explain why operating systems provide the process abstraction — what problems does it solve (for example: concurrency, isolation, resource management)?
