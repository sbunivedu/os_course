# File System Implementation

Please read the relevant chapters on file system implementation and answer the questions:

1. Explain the core on‑disk data structures introduced in the chapter for the "Very Simple File System" (vsfs): superblock, inode table, inode bitmap, data block bitmap, data blocks.

2. Choose one of these structures (for example: inode table or data block bitmap) and describe how it contributes to managing files and free space. Provide a concrete example (e.g., creating a new file, writing to it, allocating new data blocks).
