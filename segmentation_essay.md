# Segmentation

Please read the relevant chapters on memory segmentation and answer the questions:

1. Explain the limitations of the simple base + bounds scheme (single segment) for process address spaces, especially in systems with large virtual address spaces and sparse allocations.

2. Describe how segmentation generalizes base + bounds by allowing multiple logical segments (code, heap, stack, etc.) each with its own base and bounds.
