Sure! Here are the **answers** and **explanations** for all the exercise questions.

## **Answers to Exercise 1: Warm-up – Understanding `malloc` and `free`**
### **Q1: What happens if you don’t call `free(ptr);`?**
If `free(ptr);` is not called, the allocated memory remains **unreleased** until the program terminates. This is called a **memory leak**, which can lead to excessive memory consumption over time in long-running programs.

### **Q2: Try running `valgrind` to check for memory leaks. What does it report?**
Valgrind detects a memory leak and reports:
```
LEAK SUMMARY:
   definitely lost: 4 bytes in 1 blocks
   indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
   still reachable: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
   suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
```
If `free(ptr);` is added, Valgrind reports **no leaks**.

### **Q3: Use `man malloc` and `man free` to understand these functions.**
- `malloc(size_t size)`: Allocates `size` bytes of memory. Returns a pointer to the allocated memory or `NULL` if allocation fails.
- `free(void *ptr)`: Releases allocated memory, preventing leaks.

## **Answers to Exercise 2: Allocating Arrays and Exploring Memory Addresses**
### **Q1: Are the addresses printed contiguous?**
Yes! Since an array is allocated as a single block in heap memory, the addresses should be contiguous, increasing by `sizeof(int)` (typically 4 bytes).

### **Q2: What happens if you access an index beyond the allocated size?**
Accessing `arr[10]` (beyond the allocated range) results in **undefined behavior**. It may:
- Access unintended memory
- Cause a segmentation fault (`Segmentation fault (core dumped)`)
- Corrupt adjacent memory

### **Q3: Try using `calloc` instead of `malloc`. What differences do you observe?**
- `calloc(n, size)` initializes all allocated memory to **zero**, unlike `malloc`, which leaves memory uninitialized.
- Running the program with `calloc` results in an array where all elements start at `0`.

## **Answers to Exercise 3: Comparing Stack and Heap Addresses**
### **Q1: Are the addresses of the stack and heap variables close to each other?**
No! The **stack** grows downward, while the **heap** grows upward. Heap and stack memory reside in different regions.

### **Q2: Run the program multiple times. Do the heap addresses change? Why?**
Yes! Heap addresses **change** due to **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)**, which randomizes memory locations for security.

### **Q3: Use `man sbrk` to learn how memory is allocated for the heap.**
`sbrk(0)` returns the **current program break**, which indicates where the heap ends.

---

## **Answers to Exercise 4: Observing Memory Segmentation**
### **Q1: How does the `brk` value change after `malloc`?**
Before `malloc`, `brk` is at a certain address. After `malloc`, it **increases**, as heap memory expands.

### **Q2: What happens if you allocate a large amount of memory?**
If a large amount of memory is allocated (e.g., `malloc(1GB)`):
- The heap expands significantly.
- The OS might allocate memory in a **different region**, or the program may crash if there’s not enough memory.

## **Answers to Exercise 5: Demonstrating Virtual Address Space with `getpid` and `pmap`**
### **Q1: Which segment contains dynamically allocated memory?**
The `heap` segment. Run `pmap $(pgrep mem_layout)` to confirm.

### **Q2: Does the heap start at the same address every time?**
No. **ASLR** randomizes the heap's starting address for security.

---

## **Answers to Exercise 6: Detecting Memory Leaks with `valgrind`**
### **Q1: What does `valgrind` report?**
Without `free()`, `valgrind` detects **memory leaks**:
```
LEAK SUMMARY:
   definitely lost: 40 bytes in 1 blocks
```
After fixing the leak (`free(ptr);`), Valgrind reports **"All heap blocks were freed"**.

### **Q2: Modify the program to free the memory. Does `valgrind` still detect a leak?**
No! Properly freeing memory ensures **no leaks**.

---

## **Answers to Exercise 7: Dangling Pointers & Use-After-Free**
### **Q1: What happens when you try to access `*ptr` after `free(ptr);`?**
- The pointer becomes **dangling** (pointing to freed memory).
- Accessing it causes **undefined behavior** (crash or garbage value).

### **Q2: Use `valgrind` to detect use-after-free issues.**
Valgrind reports:
```
Invalid read of size 4
Address 0x... was freed
```
This confirms a **use-after-free** issue.

---

## **Answers to Exercise 8: Memory Mapping with `mmap`**
### **Q1: How is `mmap` different from `malloc`?**
- `malloc` uses **heap**, whereas `mmap` maps memory **directly from the OS**.
- `mmap` can allocate **non-contiguous** memory.
- `mmap` allows **file-backed** memory mapping.

### **Q2: What happens if you try to access `arr[0]` after `munmap(mem, size);`?**
- The program crashes (`Segmentation fault`).
- Accessing unmapped memory is **undefined behavior**.

### **Q3: Use `pmap $(pgrep mmap_test)` to inspect memory.**
You will see a separate **mapped memory region** in the output, labeled **"[ anon ]"**.

---

## **Answers to Exercise 9: Shared Memory with `mmap`**
### **Q1: What happens when one process writes to memory?**
- The written data **persists**.
- Another process can **read** the modified data.

### **Q2: Can you use `mmap` as an alternative to traditional inter-process communication methods?**
Yes! `mmap` can be used as **shared memory** instead of **pipes, sockets, or message queues**.
