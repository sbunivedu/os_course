# Swapping

Please read the relevant chapters on swapping and answer the questions:

1. Why does an OS want to provide each process with a large virtual address spaceâ€”even larger than available physical memory. What convenience or programming benefit does this abstraction provide?

2. Describe the mechanism by which the OS supports this illusion: how does paging, swap space (or disk backing), and page faults interact to allow a process to "use" more memory than physical RAM?
