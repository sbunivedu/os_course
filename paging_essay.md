# Paging

Please read the relevant chapters on paging and answer the questions:

1. Explain why the simple segmentation or base+bounds approach becomes problematic in modern systems (e.g., large address spaces, fragmentation, sparse allocation) and how paging addresses those problems.

2. Describe the basic mechanism of paging: how a virtual address is translated into a physical frame via a page table.
