# File System

Please read the relevant chapters on file system concepts and answer the questions:

1. A file system uses two core abstractions: the file (a linear array of bytes) and the directory (a mapping from user‐visible names to low‐level names/inodes). Explain in your own words why these abstractions are so central to operating systems and user programs.

2. Describe how these abstractions simplify application programming (give an example of a program that uses files/directories).
