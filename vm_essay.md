# The Virtual Address Space Abstraction

The textbook introduces the concept of an address space and the API (how programs request memory) to it. Please read the relevant chapters and answer the questions:

1. Describe how supporting private virtual address spaces for processes helps the operating system meet key goals (e.g., isolation, simplicity, programmability).

2. Describe the difference between stack memory, heap memory (via malloc/free), and memory that can be mapped (e.g., via mmap).
