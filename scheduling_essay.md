# FIFO vs. SJF vs. STCF
The textbook covers several classic scheduling disciplines: FIFO (First‐In, First‐Out / FCFS), SJF (Shortest Job First), and STCF (Shortest Time to Completion First, preemptive SJF). Please read the relevant chapters and answer the following questions:

1. For each of the three scheduling policies, describe how it works and identify one workload scenario in which it behaves very well and one in which it behaves poorly (you may invent job lengths, arrival times, etc.).

2. Explain the "convoy effect" in the context of FIFO.
